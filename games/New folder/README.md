# NebulaX Runner – Pack

Files:
- index.html — game with Nebby animation support (Canvas only).
- nebby_static.png — rear-facing Nebby (straight-back).
- nebby_run_sheet.png — 6-frame placeholder spritesheet (same pose repeated). Replace with a true run cycle later.

Run: unzip and open index.html.
Controls: ←/→ rotate, Space to jump/double-jump, P pause, R restart.

To upgrade to a real animation, drop in a 1×6 sheet at 512×512 per frame named `nebby_run_sheet.png` (kept bottom-center consistent).
